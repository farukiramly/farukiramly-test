<h4>HOW TO CLEAN A FISH: STEPS</h4>
<p>If you are planning on cooking your fish whole or if you are going to steak it, rather than filleting it, you must learn how to gut a fish. </p>
<ol>
  <li>To begin, rest the fish on the table or cutting board.
    Insert the knife tip into the fish's belly near the anal opening and move the blade up along the belly,
     cutting to the head.</li>
<li>Keep the knife blade shallow so you don't puncture the intestines.</li>
<li>Spread the body open and remove all of the entrails, locate the fish's anus and cut this out in a "V" or notch shape.</li>
<li>Some fish have a kidney by the backbone. Remove it by scraping it out with a spoon or your thumbnail.</li>
<li>Rinse the cavity out with a good stream of water and wash the skin.
  Some fish have a dark tissue lining the abdominal cavity that can be scraped off to prevent a strong, oily flavor.</li>
<li>Remove the head if you like, trout are often cooked with the head on.</li>
<li>Clean your fish-cleaning table immediately, collect the guts, heads, and scales, and discard them properly.</li>
<li>Your clean fish is now ready to be cooked.</li>
</ol>
<br><br>
<h4>HOW TO CLEAN A FISH: TIPS AND WARNING</h4>
