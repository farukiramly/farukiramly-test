  <h1>Basic Principle of Baking</h1>
  <p>“Baking can often be referred to as the chemistry of cooking. All ingredients must be accurately measured, and measurement is critical.”---- Anonymous</p>
<br>
<p>Baking is an altogether new world that incorporates an entire set of new principles, techniques,
   and strategies and figuring out how to bake can take numerous years. In the culinary business, it is so wide that it is generally done as a specialization.
To help you out with the basic principles of baking, we have categorized the complete process of baking below!</p><br><br>

<h2>Ingredients</h2>
<img src="Image/ingredient.jpg" height="250" width="350" alt="Ingredients">
<p>If you were to substitute carrots for turnips in a stew, would you observe an extreme change in the flavour?
  Not so much. The impact would be almost none. With regards to baked desserts,
  changing an ingredient produces an enormous impact on the dessert and can on a very basic level change the dessert.
  There are various flours, fluids, fats, and sugars that all work in a different way. Even the temperature of all the ingredients should be perfect for a perfect dessert.
  Bread flour and cake flour are not the same, nor are butter and shortening.
  Substitute one element for another, and the outcome will be totally unique.
  So, choosing the accurate ingredients according to the recipe you are following is very important.
If you have a good understanding of ingredients, how they function and what they do your baking experiences will be much more successful and consistent.</p>

<h2>Different Types of Flours</h2>
<img src="Image/flour.jpg" height="250" width="350" alt="Types of flour">
<p>There are many different types of flours out there. For the purpose of keeping this article short and to the point,
  we will focus on the most popular flours available and expound on this topic further in the future.
  As we learn how to bake, we will need to learn more but right now the basics are fine.</p>
<p>Wheat flour is the most popular flour that is used in baking. It comes in a variety of different types.
  Wheat flour is the only flour that is capable of producing gluten. Gluten is the tough, rubbery substance created
   when wheat flour is mixed with water. Gluten forms strands and is both plastic (Changing shape under pressure),
   and elastic (Returning to original shape when pressure is removed). Gluten is what is responsible for the texture,
   appearance, and volume of your finished baking goods. It helps provide structure and helps contain gasses within the dough
   given off by leavening agents. If there was no gluten, you would not have raised bread.</p>
   <p>The higher the protein count inside a flour determines how much gluten will form when mixed into the dough.
     Flour is categorized by “hard” flour and “soft” flour depending on the flours hardness. The higher the protein content,
     the harder the flour kernel used to produce the flour. These different flours are combined to produce what you see in the stores today,
      such as pastry flour, all-purpose flour, and bread flour.</p>
    <p>All-purpose flour is approximately 2/3 hard and 1/3 soft flour and is widely used in home applications.
         It can be substituted in some recipes, but professional bakeries and shops rarely use all-purpose.
         Instead, they opt to use flours more suited to their needs.</p>

<h2>Mixing Methods</h2>
<img src="Image/mixing.jpg" height="250" width="350" alt="Mixing methods">
<p>There are certain mixing methods that are used to produce different batters and doughs. Knowing these methods are important and many recipes will assume you know the differences between them. After reviewing this article, you will probably start to see some inconsistencies and fallacies in your search for baking recipes. If you know that a certain method is required and the recipe is erroneously calling for a different method, apply the method you know as correct to ensure proper product. Many of these erroneous recipes are fundamentally flawed and should be avoided as they usually make up for the problems by overcompensating in other areas.</p>
<p>There are several mixing methods to know, and we will cover the basics while expanding on others in further articles. These are:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Beating - Vigorously mixing foods to incorporate air and develop gluten. Use the Paddle attachment</li>
    <li>Blending - Mixing two or more ingredients to evenly distribute. Use the Paddle attachment</li>
    <li>Creaming - Combining softened fat and sugar while incorporating air. Use Paddle attachment, medium speed</li>
    <li>Cutting - Incorporating solid fat into dry ingredients until lumps of the desired size occur. Use pastry cutter or fingers, Paddle attachment</li>
    <li>Folding - Very gently incorporating ingredients such as whipped cream or eggs with dry ingredients or batter. Use Spatula</li>
    <li>Kneading - Working a dough to produce gluten by repeatedly folding the dough onto itself. Use hands or Dough Hook</li>
    <li>Stirring - Gently mixing ingredients by hand until blended. Use whisk, spoon or spatula</li>
    <li>Sifting - Using a fine mesh to pass dry ingredients though to remove lumps and aerate. Use sifter</li>
    <li>Whipping - Beating vigorously to incorporate air. Use whisk or Whisk attachment</li>
</ul>

<h2>Heating</h2>
<img src="Image/preheat.jpg" height="250" width="350" alt="Preheat oven">
<p>Preheating the oven is as significant as extending the legs before a run, or heating up the vehicle before starting, or letting the water get hot before you go for a shower. Preheating is important to give an underlying push of warmth. Numerous dough and batters which are made utilizing leavening agents like yeast, baking powder or baking soda require a decent push of warmth toward the start for the ideal ascent, texture, and browning. That’s why it is instructed to preheat the oven while you prepare the batter.
